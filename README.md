## 📌 Executive Summary  
With the growing volume of video content, extracting key insights and testing comprehension manually is time consuming. *AI Video Summarization & Quiz Generation* automates this: it transcribes video using **Whisper**, summarizes with **BART**, and generates quiz questions automatically. A Flask-based frontend provides a clean interface so users can upload videos, get summaries, and test understanding without extra work.

---

## 🏦 Business Problem  
- Consumers, students, and professionals often lack time to go through long videos in full.  
- Important information can be missed if there is no summary or highlight of key points.  
- Assessments (quizzes) to check learning or retention are usually manual and laborious.

## 🔬 Methodology  
1. **Video Upload & Audio Extraction**: Accept MP4 uploads; extract audio via tools like `moviepy` / `pydub`.  
2. **Transcription**: Use OpenAI’s Whisper model to convert speech to text.  
3. **Summarization**: Use BART (from Huggingface) to compress the transcription into meaningful summaries.  
4. **Quiz Generation**: From the summary, generate quiz questions using custom NLP logic.  
5. **Web Interface**: Build a Flask frontend so users can upload, view summaries & quiz, in a simple UI.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated  
- **AI/NLP**: Transcription (speech → text), summarization, question generation.  
- **Model Integration**: Working with Whisper, BART, transformer models.  
- **Backend Engineering**: Python, Flask, handling file uploads, process orchestration.  
- **Frontend/UI Basics**: HTML, CSS, template rendering for interaction.  
- **Data Processing & Automation**: Audio extraction, text processing pipelines.

## 📊 Results & Business Recommendation  
- Produced a working end-to-end system: video → summary → quiz.  
- Speeds up learning and content consumption; lowers cost/time for content creators or educators.  
- Could be used as a tool in e-learning platforms or corporate training portals.  
- Recommendation: secure hosting, usage tracking, user feedback to improve summaries/quiz accuracy, possibly subscription model or API access for 3rd-party integration.

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Improve quiz generation quality: more types of questions (true/false, fill-in, multiple choice) and better content coverage.  
- Add user accounts/authentication so users can save summaries/quizzes.  
- Integrate multimedia support: support more video formats, subtitle files.  
- Build analytics dashboard to track usage, quiz performance, summary accuracy.  
- Deploy using Docker / cloud service (AWS / GCP / Heroku) for production readiness.
